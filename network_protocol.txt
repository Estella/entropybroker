session setup:
	- 4 bytes ascii value protocol version
	- 4 bytes length of string:
		- string containing a random used for authentication *1
	- 4 bytes length of string:
		- string containing username

	- broker then expects 64 bytes of data from the connecting party containing a SHA512 hash of:
		random *1 concated with a space and then the password

	If this hash equals to the one calculated by the broker, then the connection proceeds.
	If not, the broker just closes the connection.

loop:
	- client/server send 4 bytes ascii containing a command-code:
		0001: get bits

		0002: put bits

		0003: server type (type of a process producing entropy data)
			- 4 bytes ascii value length of string:
				- an ascii string describing the server. format is arbitrary

		0006: client type
			- 4 bytes ascii value length of string:
				- an ascii string describing the client. format is arbitrary

		0008: number of bits the kernel of the connected process has
			- 4 bytes ascii value length of string:
				- an ascii string describing the number of bits

		0011: proxy auth
			- regular session setup
			- then, a 0012 reply is send with 0 = ok (yes, that is correct) and 1 = fail
